# DeepGaze

An experiment in real-time object detection & classification with Flutter and Tensorflow

### A little background

I decided to do this as a joint semester project for my Mobile Computing (CS-471) and Artificial Intelligence (CS-632) courses. I was originally planning on using React Native but react-native-camera doesn't expose a way to recieve the camera feed in real-time because apparently, it locks up the bridge (see [#135](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/issues/135#issuecomment-165710613))
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
